## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design inside the `/design` folder. 

The design is in static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `color`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.


## Building your project

1. Create a new (free) Firebase project.
2. Create a Cloud Firestore Database for the project.
3. Create a Collection where tasks will be saved.
4. Go to the project config page and copy the firebaseConfig info.
